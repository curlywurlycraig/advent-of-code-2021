# Advent of Code, 2021.

I'm doing it in Clojure this year. I enjoy the expressiveness of the
language and I'm also using it right now for a compiler, so it will be
good to sharpen that skill.

Running the code in each repo should be as simple as executing `clj -X
day-a.partb/main` (I'm using `deps.edn`). If that directory differs,
it will include a markdown file to describe how to execute.
